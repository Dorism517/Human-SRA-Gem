# Hello!
### **Welcome to my repository!**
This repository was created as part of a medical bioinformatics project to combine learned knowledge.
## What you should learn when using my code to make a GEM out of Human SRA data:
- [ ] Understand the concept of GEM creation, including the necessary software to create a GEM
- [ ] Learn the processes that can be done to GEMs in order to analyze their data
- [ ] Analyze a downstream workflow of your created GEM
- [ ] Learn about austism spectrum disorder and the differences in Purkinje neurons between ASD patients and control patients
- [ ] Learn more about coding! :)
